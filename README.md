# Reflection
During the making of the game, I originally wanted to do no monsters, but then I wanted to make some sort of chase scene where the monster will kill you, so I decided to add monsters for the thrill. I planned it so that you would basically walk around the map and explore with scary background noises. That, and just some random jumpscares if you got to a certain part of the map. However, I wanted to add some objective to the game so that’s why I decided to add “finding keys” as the goal of the game. And the jumpscares are basically the monsters that kill you when you don’t see them. So, what I learned during this whole process was first navigating through Unity and all the assets that come with it. Using platforms like Unity was a new experience because there was so much going on it felt a bit intimidating. However, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials on how to use Unity and I got a bit used to Unity now. The second thing I learned was C#, not that I’m saying I’m a master now, but I understand some parts of how to use it. Youtube and Google were the most useful tools for me while learning how to use C# and make the game in general.
